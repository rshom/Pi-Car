# PiCar

The PiCar uses an Adeept Mars Rover^[[https://www.adeept.com/picar-b_p0117.html](https://www.adeept.com/picar-b_p0117.html)] hardware base. 
This code is based on object orientated programming principles and creates a library which is easy to use, functional, and documented.

This project is a work in progress and still needs to be updated before it is ready for non-developer use.

## Getting Started

Build the Mars Rover using instructions included with the product and install the software which comes with it.
Then clone this project on to the PiCar, install any requirements not aleady installed.

The client.py script should go on a PC which can control the PiCar.
Both the client.py and server.py have IP addresses which will need to be changed.

### Prerequisites

See requirements.txt

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
