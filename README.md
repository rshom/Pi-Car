# PiCar

The PiCar uses an Adeept Mars Rover^[[https://www.adeept.com/picar-b_p0117.html](https://www.adeept.com/picar-b_p0117.html)] hardware base. 
This code is based on object orientated programming principles and creates a library which is easy to use, functional, and documented.

This project is a work in progress and still needs to be updated before it is ready for non-developer use.

## Getting Started

Build the Mars Rover using instructions included with the product and install the software which comes with it.

The client.py script should go on a PC which can control the PiCar.
Both the client.py and server.py have IP addresses which will need to be changed.

### Prerequisites

See requirements.txt

### Installing

Move picar repo onto picar and install requirements.
Change IPs to match your own.
